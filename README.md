TODO:
* Implement UR logics
* Implement Bent subset logics, including
  - APE : Bent subset of rank 1
  - Sue-de-coq : Bent subset of rank 0
* Find a way to further classify the type of logic (such as discerning XY-wing, XYZ-wing, WXYZ-wing, W-wing, ALS, Simple Coloring, etc.)
* Improve visual representation of AIC logic. (In particular, implement link-type annotations.)
* Refactor the graphical notation.
* Implement Exocet
* Consider using WebAssembly (such as AssemblyScript) to improve speed.
* Make it frigging interactive! Darn it...



The functionalities I need:
* Loops through the edges of the specified types incident to a given (set of) vertex.
* Loops through the vertices that are joined from a given (set of) vertex by edges of the specified types.
* Loops through the vertices in an edge.
